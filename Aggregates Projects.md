# The Met üóø

Let's look at some blin! Find all of the pieces that contain gold.

1. Where are the artworks are coming from? COUNT GROUPBY
2. Which artist is the MET interested in? SUM
3. Which department hosts the largest number of artworks?

4. You are asked to research the pieces created during World War II, which began in 1939 and ended in 1945. How many pieces in the collection were created during this time?

5. Find the oldest piece in the collection.

6. What is the total square feet across all museum locations?

7. There are all kinds of things in the Met's collection. Which category of objects is most popular? Use `COUNT` and the `category` field




```bash
$ python2
```

```py
import pandas as pd

f = pd.read_csv("/Users/sonny/Desktop/met.csv")

f = f[['Object ID', 'Department', 'Object Name', 'Title', 'Artist Display Name', 'Object Date', 'Medium', 'Country']]
```


only take 4000 rows:

```py
f = f[:4000]
```

```py
f.to_csv("met.csv", index=False)
```

delete the first row
