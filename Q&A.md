# SQL with Three Analysts!

### Nick Palumbo ###

**Data Analyst, MTD Products üöú **

I currently work at [MTD Products](http://www.mtdproducts.com/) as a data analyst, responsible for creating visualizations and building predictive models. Before I started this job, I was a marketing analyst at [Medical Mutual of Ohio](https://www.medmutual.com/).

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

I use SQL to access customer records that meet certain qualifications. 

For instance:

- *How many customers do we have from online orders in the last 4 weeks?*
- *How many of our call center customers gave us a valid first name?*
- *How many of them gave us a last name of 'Unknown', 'N/A', or '.'?*

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to marketing?**

`JOIN`s are essential for getting the information I need that came from different processes, but `CASE WHEN` is also very important, as it allows you to create flags for the end user to answer their questions about how the data breaks down.

**Where did you learn SQL?**

I learned SQL from an EdX class called [Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/sabermetrics-101-introduction-baseball-bux-sabr101x-0).

**Are there any datasets that you particularly found interesting or enjoyed working with?**

I like the [mtcars](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.4.3/topics/mtcars) (Motor Trend Car Road Tests) dataset used in R, but I especially liked using the [Lahman Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). It is a great tool for seeing how you can use joins and calculated fields to answer questions that are typically posed in the real world.

### Blake Burch - Data Innovation Lead, PMG üì± ###

I lead up the Data Innovation team at [PMG: Digital Marketing Agency](https://www.pmg.com/) to develop automation and algorithms for our top-tier brands.

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

I use SQL to:

- Power automated reports/dashboards
- Create calculations for ongoing bidding/budgeting decisions
- Power the logic that generates bulk upload sheets for teams
- Find anomalies in our data sets
- Alert on QA issues found in accounts
- Alert on potentially missing data from our warehouse

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to your work?**

Window functions put you leagues ahead and reduce the amount of SQL you have to write to get to the answers you want.
`CASE` statements are used all of the time to help classify our data into segments for client goals and strategies.
It's also extremely important to get comfortable with long sub-queries. They're a necessary evil to format the data in the best way possible.

**What got you into the data field?**

I love working with technology and am passionate about automating everything I possibly can. Once I found that I could use large data sets to automate our decision making processes, I was hooked.

**Are there any datasets that you particularly found interesting or enjoyed working with?**

A majority of the data we work with is specific to our clients' advertising efforts, pulled directly from Adwords, Bing, Facebook, and Doubleclick APIs. I've found it particularly fun to pair these advertising insights with geo data sources ([Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), US Census, Store Locations, etc.) to see how all of these factors can impact marketing efficiency in each region. Additionally, I've had a blast using the Instagram and Twitter APIs to pull post interactions from top influencers for our brands to understand how their posts ultimately drive up searches, site visits, and purchases.

**What's next?**

I want to dive deeper with Python, especially with data science packages like matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, and machine learning packages (like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch). I have a basic level of knowledge right now and can write fully operational scripts, but I don't know the ins-and-outs by heart.

### Jacob Inurrigarro - Business Systems Analyst, Health Fitness üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ###

Currently working on an enterprise agile application development team eliciting business process needs from the company and then translating them into functional and non-functional requirements. ([Health Fitness Corporation](http://healthfitness.com/))

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

Querying data from multiple sources to identify trends in product usage, potential data mismatches, verifying the presence and/or authenticity of available data.

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to you?**

`JOIN`s. Without mastering joins I would not be able to piece data together in a meaningful manner.

**Where did you learn SQL?**

I was first exposed to SQL in college, learned a bit more from the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and continue to learn from on-the-job training. The coding examples from the W3Schools were a big help but without something practical to relate the data to some concepts just did not click for me. Now that I have come a bit further working in the abstract isn't so bad. I really wish [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) was around when I was learning SQL as it's approach would have been a huge boon: tutorials on the left, code engine in the center, and output/schema on the right.

**Are there any datasets that you particularly found interesting or enjoyed working with?**

On the idea of finding relatable and practical data - as a home owner in Texas that fears rising property taxes, I learned how to collect and analyze my county's GIS data. Armed with SQL, I am now better equipped at protesting my property taxes.
