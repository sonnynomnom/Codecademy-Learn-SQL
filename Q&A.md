# Codecademy - [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)


### Nick Palumbo - Data Analyst ###

I currently work at [MTD Products](http://www.mtdproducts.com/) as a data analyst, responsible for creating visualizations and building predictive models. Before I started this job, I was a marketing analyst at [Medical Mutual of Ohio](https://www.medmutual.com/).

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

I use SQL to access customer records that meet certain qualifications. 

For instance:

- How many customers do we have from online orders in the last 4 weeks?
- How many of our call center customers gave us a valid first name?
- How many of them gave us a last name of 'Unknown', 'N/A', or '.'?

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to marketing?**

Joins are essential for getting the information I need that came from different processes, but `CASE WHEN` is also very important, as it allows you to create flags for the end user to answer their questions about how the data breaks down.

**Where did you learn SQL?**

I learned SQL from an EdX class called [Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/sabermetrics-101-introduction-baseball-bux-sabr101x-0).

**Are there any datasets that you particularly found interesting or enjoyed working with?**

I like the mtcars (Motor Trend Car Road Tests) dataset used in R, but I especially liked using the Lahman Baseball Database. It is a great tool for seeing how you can use joins and calculated fields to answer questions that are typically posed in the real world.

### Blake Burch - Data Innovation Lead ###

Where do you work?
PMG - A Digital Marketing Agency. I lead up our Data Innovation team to develop automation and algorithms for our top-tier brands.

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

I use SQL to:
- Power automated reports/dashboards
- Create calculations for ongoing bidding/budgeting decisions
- Power the logic that generates bulk upload sheets for teams
- Find anomalies in our data sets
- Alert on QA issues found in accounts
- Alert on potentially missing data from our warehouse

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to your work?**

Window functions put you leagues ahead and reduce the amount of SQL you have to write to get to the answers you want.
`CASE` statements are used all of the time to help classify our data into segments for client goals and strategies.
It's also extremely important to get comfortable with long sub-queries. They're a necessary evil to format the data in the best way possible.

**Where did you learn SQL?**
I learned the basics from sqlzoo and from there, started playing around with our company's own data sets. Anything new I learn now is from scouring the documentation.

**Are there any datasets that you particularly found interesting or enjoyed working with?**
A majority of the data we work with is specific to our clients' advertising efforts, pulled directly from Adwords, Bing, Facebook, and Doubleclick APIs. I've found it particularly fun to pair these advertising insights with geo data sources (Google Maps API, OpenWeather API, US Census, Store Locations, etc.) to see how all of these factors can impact marketing efficiency in each region.

Additionally, I've had a blast using the Instagram and Twitter APIs to pull post interactions from top influencers for our brands to understand how their posts ultimately drive up searches, site visits, and purchases.
