## Data/Marketing Analyst

**Nick Palumbo - 3/20/2018**

I currently work at [MTD Products](http://www.mtdproducts.com/) as a data analyst, responsible for creating visualizations and building predictive models. Before I started this job, I was a marketing analyst at [Medical Mutual of Ohio](https://www.medmutual.com/).

**How do you use SQL in your day-to-day job?**

I use SQL to access customer records that meet certain qualifications. 

For instance:

- How many customers do we have from online orders in the last 4 weeks?
- How many of our call center customers gave us a valid first name?
- How many of them gave us a last name of 'Unknown', 'N/A', or '.'?

**What is a concept in SQL that's essential to marketing?**

Joins are essential for getting the information I need that came from different processes, but CASE WHEN is also very important, as it allows you to create flags for the end user to answer their questions about how the data breaks down.

**Where did you learn SQL?**

I learned SQL from an EdX class called [Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics] (https://www.edx.org/course/sabermetrics-101-introduction-baseball-bux-sabr101x-0).

Are there any datasets that you found interesting or loved working with? Or ones you dislike.

I like the mtcars (Motor Trend Car Road Tests) dataset used in R, but I especially liked using the Lahman Baseball Database. It is a great tool for seeing how you can use joins and calculated fields to answer questions that are typically posed in the real world.
